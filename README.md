This repo is created for my learning process on The Odin Project.
For this repo it is for the Landing Page of TOP.
I can say that after doing this i learnt a lot but i still much to learn. 
However, this has proved to me that i can do it even tho i kinda dont believe in myself at first 
and im so excited to move forward to learning Javascript next and more!.

Thank you The Odin Project. <3
